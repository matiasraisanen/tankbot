'''
Bot functions as follows:
Execute a distance scan every 500ms.
If distance to object is greater than 25cm, drive forward.
If distance is less than 25cm, stop and scan the environment at 45 and 135 degree angles.
Turn the bot to the direction where the distance to object was greater. Turn until at least 50cm clearance.

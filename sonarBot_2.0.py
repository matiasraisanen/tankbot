#Sonar based on: https://www.modmypi.com/blog/hc-sr04-ultrasonic-range-sensor-on-the-raspberry-pi

'''
Bot functions as follows:
Execute a distance scan every 50ms.
If distance to object is greater than 20cm, drive forward.
If distance is less than 20cm, stop and execute a sweeping scan in 180 degree arc, starting from right
to left. Start scanning for a direction, where distance to object is greater than 25.
If found, turn the bot. If not found, turn around fully.
